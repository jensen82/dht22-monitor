STM32F429 humidity/temperature monitor
======================================

This is a small monitor which will read out a DHT22 humidity sensor and print out the data over a span of multiple hours (or any other interval). It enables you to see how the humdity or temperature changes during the day.

Uses parts of the great ub_lib from [Uwe Becker](http://mikrocontroller.bplaced.net).
